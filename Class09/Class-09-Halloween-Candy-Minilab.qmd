Today we will take a small step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy.


## Data Import


```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Question 1: How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
dim(candy)
nrow(candy)
```
There are 12 different candy types in this dataset.

> Question 2: How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(sum(candy$fruity == 1))
```
## What is your favorite candy?

> Question 3: What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it's winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Starburst",]$winpercent
```
> Question 4: What is the winpercent value for "Kitkat"

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```
> Question 5: What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

## Exploratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
# the '::' tells R to go into the package to look for the function isntead of pulling up the whole thing as we do with 'libary()'
```

> Question 6: Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others.

> Question 7: What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

>Question 8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent,)
```
```{r}
library (ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, fill = "purple")
```


>Question 9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

>Question 10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
The median (center of the distribution) is below 50%

>Question 11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```
```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.candy <- candy[fruity.inds,]
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

On average, chocolate candy is ranked higher than fruity candy

```{r}
fruit.win <- candy[ as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
#another way of writing the above code chunk, it does the same thing but is just more compressed
```

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
#t.test()

ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
ans
```
Looking at the p-value of `r ans$p.value`, we can say that yes, this difference IS statistically significant!

```{r}
ans$p.value
```
## Overall Candy Rankings

> Question What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()` 

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
```
```{r}
order(x)
```
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,],5)
```

> Question 14: WHat are the top 5 all time favorite candy types in this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = T)
head(candy[inds,],5)
```

> Question 15: Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Question 16: Use the reorder() function

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill="red")
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent,
      y = reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent),
      fill=chocolate) +
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a `bar` or not

```{r}
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"
 

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width = 3, height = 6)
```

![My silly barplot](mybarplot.png)

> Question: 17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Question 18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

## Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
# Pink is too light
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 8)
```

## Exploring the Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```
> Question 22: Examining this plot what two variables are anto-correlated (have minus values)

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2 )
```

> Question 23: What two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = T)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
#pca$x
ggplot(pca$x) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 6, col=mycols) +
  theme_bw() 
  
```

The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot. 

```{r}
#pca$rotation

ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```
```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill = PC1) +
  geom_col()
```
> Question 24: What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? DO these make sense to you?

Fruity, pluribus, and hard.
