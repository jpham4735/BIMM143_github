## Background

This mini-project explores unsupervised learning techniques applied to
the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Set, which contains
measurements of human breast mass cell nuclei. The project guides the
user through exploratory data analysis, performing and interpreting
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the
data while retaining variance, and applying hierarchical clustering with
different linkage methods. It also includes an optional section on
K-means clustering for comparison. The ultimate goal is to combine PCA
and clustering to better separate benign and malignant cell samples,
evaluating the results using metrics like sensitivity and specificity,
and finally demonstrating how to predict the classification of new
samples using the developed PCA model.

## Data Import

Our data come from the U. of Wisconsin Medical Center

#read.csv("WisconsinCancer.csv")
wisc.df <- read.csv("WisconsinCancer.csv", row.names = 1)
```

> Question 1: How many patients/samples are in this dataset?

``` r
nrow(wisc.df)
```

    [1] 569

> Question 2: How many of the observations have a malignant diagnosis?

There is a diagnosis column that is the clinician consensus that I want
to exclude from any further analysis. We will come back later and
compare our results to this diagnosis.

``` r
diagnosis <- as.factor(wisc.df$diagnosis)

head(diagnosis)
```

    [1] M M M M M M
    Levels: B M

Now we can remove it from the `wisc.df`

``` r
wisc.data <- wisc.df[,-1]
```

## Clustering

Let’s try a `hclust()`

``` r
hc <- hclust(dist(wisc.data))
plot(hc)
```

![](Class08_Breast_Cancer_MiniProject_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

We can extract clusters from this rather poor dendrogram/tree with the
`cutree()`

``` r
grps <- cutree(hc, k=2)
```

How many individuals in each cluster?

``` r
table(grps)
```

    grps
      1   2 
    549  20 

``` r
table(diagnosis)
```

    diagnosis
      B   M 
    357 212 

We can generate a cross-table that compares our cluster `grps` vector
with our `diagnosis` vector values

``` r
table(diagnosis, grps)
```

             grps
    diagnosis   1   2
            B 357   0
            M 192  20

## Principal Component Analysis

### The importance of data scalling

The main function for PCA in base R is `prcomp()` it has a default input
parameter of `scale=FALSE`.

``` r
#prcomp()
head(mtcars)
```

                       mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
    Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
    Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
    Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
    Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
    Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
    Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1

We coudl do a PCA of this data as is and it could be mis-leading…

``` r
pc <- prcomp(mtcars)
biplot(pc)
```

![](Class08_Breast_Cancer_MiniProject_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)

Let’s look at the mean values of each column and their standard
deviation.

``` r
colMeans(mtcars)
```

           mpg        cyl       disp         hp       drat         wt       qsec 
     20.090625   6.187500 230.721875 146.687500   3.596563   3.217250  17.848750 
            vs         am       gear       carb 
      0.437500   0.406250   3.687500   2.812500 

``` r
apply(mtcars, 2, sd)
```

            mpg         cyl        disp          hp        drat          wt 
      6.0269481   1.7859216 123.9386938  68.5628685   0.5346787   0.9784574 
           qsec          vs          am        gear        carb 
      1.7869432   0.5040161   0.4989909   0.7378041   1.6152000 

We can “scale” this data before PCA to get a much better representation
and analysis of all the columns

``` r
mtscale <- scale(mtcars)
```

``` r
round(colMeans(mtscale))
```

     mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb 
       0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 

``` r
apply(mtscale, 2, sd)
```

     mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb 
       1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1 

``` r
pc.scale <- prcomp(mtscale)
```

We can look at the two main results figures from PCA - the “PC plot”
(a.k.a. score plot, ordienation plot, or PC1 vs PC2 plot). The “loadings
plot” how the original variables contribute to the new PCs

A loadings plot of the unscalled PCA results

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(pc$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pc$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

``` r

```

> Key point: In general we will set `scale=TRUE` wehn we do PCA. This is
> not the default but probably should be…

We can check the SD and mean of the different columns in `wisc.data` to
see if we need to scale - hint: we do!

### PCA of wisc.data

``` r
wisc.pr <- prcomp(wisc.data, scale=T)
```

To see how well PCA is doing here in terms capturing the variance (or
spread) in the data we can use the `summary()` function.

``` r
summary(wisc.pr)
```

> Question 7: What stands out to you about this plot? Is it easy or
> difficult to understand? Why?

What stands out is the main cluster of data in the middle of the plot,
which makes it extremely difficult to understand due to the close
proximity of the data points to one another.

``` r
plot(wisc.pr$x, col = diagnosis, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```

![](Class08_Breast_Cancer_MiniProject_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)

> Question 8: Generate a similar plot for principal components 1 and 3.
> What do you notice about these plots?

These plots very similar in their data points but the plot for PC1 and
PC3 has better grouping compared to the first plot where there is less
intermingling of benign and malignant data points.

``` r
plot(wisc.pr$x[,-2], col=diagnosis, xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC3")
```

![](Class08_Breast_Cancer_MiniProject_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)

Let’s make the main PC1 vs PC2

``` r
ggplot(wisc.pr$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=diagnosis) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("PC1 (44.3%)") +
  ylab("PC2 (19%)")

> Question 10: Using the plot() and abline() functions, what is the
> height at which the clustering model has 4 clusters?

``` r
data.scaled <- scale(wisc.data)
```

``` r
data.dist <- dist(data.scaled)
```

``` r
wisc.hclust <- hclust(data.dist, method = "complete")
```

``` r
plot(wisc.hclust)
abline(h = 19, col="red", lty=2)
```

![](Class08_Breast_Cancer_MiniProject_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png)

At height 19 the clustering model has 4 clusters.

> Question 12: Which method gives your favorite results for the same
> data.dist dataset?

The method = “complete” gives our favorite results because it is
sensitive to noise in the data set and can help create compact clusters.

## 5. Combining methods

We can take our PCA results and use them as a basis set for other
analysis such as clustering.

### Clustering on PCA results

``` r
wisc.pr.hclust <- hclust( dist(wisc.pr$x[,1:2]), method = "ward.D2" )
plot(wisc.pr.hclust)
```

![](Class08_Breast_Cancer_MiniProject_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png)

We can “cut” this tree to yield our clusters (groups):

``` r
pc.grps <- cutree(wisc.pr.hclust, k=2)
table(pc.grps)
```

    pc.grps
      1   2 
    195 374 

How do my cluster groups compare to the expert diagnosis

``` r
table(diagnosis, pc.grps)
```

             pc.grps
    diagnosis   1   2
            B  18 339
            M 177  35

``` r
table(diagnosis)
```

    diagnosis
      B   M 
    357 212 

> Question 13: How well does the newly created model with four clusters
> seperate out the two diagnoses?

The newly created model with four clusters separates out the two
diagnoses very clearly and makes a more easy to read dendrogram with the
same amount of information.

> Qustion 14: How well do the hierarchical clustering models you created
> in previous sections do in terms of separitng the diagnoses? Again,
> use the table() function to compare the output of each model with the
> vector containing the actual diagrams

They did really baddly. We do much better after PCA - the new PCA
variables (what we call a basis set) give us much better seperation of M
and B

## 7. Prediction

we can use our PCA model for the analysis of new “unseen” data. In this
case from U. Mich.

``` r
#url <- "new_samples.csv"
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/new-samples-CSV"
new <- read.csv(url)
npc <- predict(wisc.pr, newdata=new)
npc
```
